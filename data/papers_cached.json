    "title": "Minimization of peak age of information  in LoRaWAN-based monitoring systems",
    "abstract": "We  study the communication network based on LoRaWAN technology. The communication network consists of N nodes and carries out one-way transmission of monitoring data to the base station (BS).  The messages from each node are sent to the BS at random time intervals and independently of each other. If they have the same spreading factor (SF) and airtimes of messages from two or more nodes overlap, a collision occurs and none of the messages reaches the operator. We assume that the importance of information from each node is different, and the peak  age of information (PAoI) is used \tto measure its freshness. We define the functional as the maximum PAoI among all nodes in the system, and our task is to find the parameters under which its minimization is achieved.\tWe choose various message intensities to account for different freshness of information from each node and formulate the problem of optimal SF allocation.",

    "abstract": "Aiming to accommodate a large number of devices for low-bandwidth data\r\ntransmission, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) encapsulates the concept\r\nof the Internet of Things [1]. However, an efficient power conservation paradigm\r\nfor battery-powered NB-IoT devices is crucial. In addition to the traditional\r\nDiscontinuous Reception (DRX) method, efficient beamforming helps to conserve\r\ndevice battery [2]. Further, the extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) mode\r\nand Power Saving Mode (PSM) in Radio Resource Control (RRC) inactive\r\nmode increase the effect of sleep when there is no data available for the device\r\nto serve [3, 4]. Using stochastic models, power-saving techniques for NB-IoT\r\ndevices are investigated in this paper. This paper proposes a semi-Markov model\r\n(SMM) for beam measurement and beamforming-based DRX in RRC modes. The\r\nSMM\u2019s steady-state probabilities are calculated using a two-stage method [5]. The\r\nnumerical results demonstrate the contribution of efficient beamforming, eDRX\r\nstate, and PSM state to the enhancement of NB-IoT devices\u2019 power efficiency.",

    "title": "Semi-orthogonal Precoder for Improving Throughput and Fairness in Downlink NOMA-MIMO Systems",
    "abstract": "In Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems, the base station can simultaneously transmit data from an antenna to a group of users. In this group, a user with higher channel gains performs  Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) to mitigate interference from the signal destined for the user with a weak channel. Typically, downlink NOMA-MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) systems use precoders that form beams focused on users with higher channel gains of each group. This approach induces interference on the users with low gain, degrading throughputs and fairness in the network. This paper proposes a novel semi-orthogonal precoder that forms non-orthogonal beams for users within each group, while maintaining orthogonality between the groups. Simulations show the efficiency of this approach in improving the geometric mean user throughput.",

    "title": "Influence of Access Points' Height and High Signal Relation in WLAN Fingerprinting-Based Indoor Positioning Systems' Accuracy",
    "abstract": "Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Fingerprinting-based Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) offer several key advantages over other indoor positioning technologies, including cost-effectiveness with high accuracy and passive tracking of entities' location without Global Positioning System (GPS) dependence. However, achieving a satisfactory accuracy performance of the WLAN fingerprinting-based IPS is still challenging, as it is affected by several factors, such as obstacles (e.g., walls and furniture) that can block or weaken wireless signals. Additionally, the IPS's accuracy can be affected by environmental changes, such as the height, addition, or removal of a WLAN Access Point (AP) or changes in radio frequency interference. This paper presents a novel algorithm incorporating a probabilistic analytical model employing only high signal relations that mitigate the effect of low signal relation on the WLAN fingerprinting-based IPS, thus improving the accuracy performance. Furthermore, it analyses the impact of AP heights on the accuracy performance of the WLAN IPS. Upon extensive experiments, the proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of the IPS by an average of 32.74% in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). These results imply that incorporating APs' height and high signal relations can significantly improve the accuracy performance of the WLAN fingerprinting-based IPS.",

For a class of applications utilizing URLLC service - periodic state updates, a vital metric of interest is Age of Information (AoI) characterizing the timeliness of updates received. The analysis of latency-related metrics in 5G cellular systems is however complicated by the orthogonal-frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) specifics resulting in batch service of packets. In this paper, we formalize the solve a queuing model capturing the specifics of URLLC service over OFDMA-enabled systems by explicitly accounting for batch service. For this model, we derive the mean peak AoI (PAoI).",

    "abstract": "The future 6G cellular systems are expected to utilize the lower part of the terahertz frequency band, 100-300 GHz. As a result of high path losses, the coverage of such systems will be limited to a few tens of meters making them suitable for indoor environments. As compared to outdoor deployments, indoor usage of THz systems is characterized by the need to operate over shorter distances using the reflected propagation paths. This paper aims to characterize the impact of blockage of reflected propagation paths in typical scenarios. Specifically, we carry out a detailed measurements campaign at 156 GHz and report reflection losses, blockage losses over the reflected path as well as blockage duration, signal fall and rise times. Our results show that signal polarization has a profound impact on the reflection losses with E-plane horizontally oriented signal losses being at least 8 dB higher as compared to H-plane signal horizontal orientation. Furthermore, the reflection material types do not affect the mean blockage attenuation over the reflected paths. Generally, the presence of a reflector neither quantitatively nor qualitative changes the mean attenuation induced by a blockage phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Beamtracking is a critical functionality in modern millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G New Radio (NR) systems  and is expected to become even more critical in future 6G systems operating in terahertz (THz) frequency band. To enable uninterrupted connectivity base stations (BS) need to invoke this procedure periodically. Due to the use of massive antenna arrays in 6G THz systems, the amount of resources consumed by beamtracking will be extremely large making the time interval between sweeping beam configurations a very critical parameter. One of the phenomena affecting the choice of this interval is a user equipment (UE) micromobility - quick displacements and rotations of UE in the hands of a user happening even when the latter is in a stationary position. In this paper, by utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms, we propose a procedure for the detection of the beam center at the BS side for applications characterized by different types of micromobility. We demonstrate that one can safely differentiate between applications characterized by low as well as distinctively different micromobility speeds. All the considered classifieds including the tree, random forest, and neural network perform qualitatively similarly. For applications having fast and similar micromobility speeds such as VR and gaming, the classification accuracy stays at around 85-90%. However, this loss in accuracy does not affect the ultimate goal of the remote application detection algorithm - understanding how often the beam alignment procedure must be invoked at UE and BS.",

    "title": "Estimation of MAP component decoding of product codes in two-state channels",
    "abstract": "Product code construction is a powerful tool for both channels with and without memory. The common approach to decoding product (iterative) code is to apply consequent decoders in a sequential manner. The paper examines the influence of memory in the channel on iterative decoding for hard decision, soft decision, and trellis-based decoding algorithms. Also, the attainable performance of iterative schemes with and without knowledge of channel state information is presented.",

    "title": "Risk management in the design of computer network topology",
    "abstract": "Problems of a computer network risk management are often reduce to choosing the optimal set of countermeasures. The possibility of the network topology modification is usually not considered when solving such a problems. At the same time, the topology rebuilding is a natural process for some classes of networks (in particular, wireless mesh networks). This study considers the problem of designing the risk-minimizing computer network topology. The proposed solution is based on the results previously obtained in the research of the influence of the complex systems structure on their integral risk. The paper considers a particular case of the exact solution of the problem for a peer-to-peer distributed network of the \"bus\" topology. Also it proposes an algorithm for designing a risk-minimizing topology under attack scenarios of a simple chain structure.",

Customers arrive according to a Markovian Arrival Process and the service time follows a phase type distribution. The activation time of the server is exponentially distributed. We obtain stationary distribution of the queuing process using the Matrix Geometric Method. Using these distribution we calculate performance measures of the system. We also analyse this model numerically in order to have a comparison of the performance measures associated with it. An illustrative numerical example is discussed.",

It is critical for the UE to maximize its\r\nenergy efficiency for both LTE-A and LTE-5G networks. To obtain the energy\r\nefficiency from LTE-A and LTE-5G networks, we have developed three stochastic\r\nmodels, namely the Markov model and semi-Markov model, for the UE based on\r\nthe states of discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism and Markov regenerative\r\nprocess (MRGP) for the Modified DRX mechanism. Explicit expressions are\r\nderived for steady-state system size probabilities for all the models. Further,\r\nbased on the states of DRX mechanism, energy saving in the UE is computed\r\nand sensitivity analysis is performed for the Markov and semi-Markov models.\r\nFor the MRGP model, we have obtained the system\u2019s optimal energy saving and\r\nthroughput by optimizing the maximum short sleep and short sleep duration.\r\nTo get the energy efficiency for LTE-5G networks, the trade-off between average\r\nenergy consumption/energy saving and throughput is shown. Further, our\r\nanalysis of DRX mechanism and conclusion on its performance can be designed\r\nand implemented to an extension for the existing DRX mechanism. We believe\r\nthat, these models can also be extended to study the energy saving of hardware\r\nand other components of the system.",

For data generation we simulate an appropriate queueing system. We used an auxiliary Fourier series correction factor by training the neural network. As a result, the quality of the queue length estimation expressed in form of the empirical distribution function of an absolute error was considerably improved.",

The system is a finite-source M/M/1//N type, and the idle server can make calls to the customers in the orbit, also known as secondary customers. The service time of the primary and secondary customers follow independent exponential distributions with rates of \u03bc_1 and \u03bc_2, respectively. The novelty of this study is to analyze the impact of various distributions of failure time on the key performance measures using a backup server, such as the mean response time of an arbitrary customer. One could think of a backup server as a primary server that operates at a reduced rate during periods of repair. To ensure a valid comparison, a fitting process is conducted so that the mean and variance of every distribution are equal. The self-developed simulation program provides graphical illustrations of the results.",

    "abstract": "Increasing reliability and reducing delays in multipath networks is achieved due to redundancy of paths and the ability to balance their workload. The possibility of increasing the reliability of transmissions and reducing the delays of the most critical packets is provided by the replication of packet transmissions along different routes of their delivery to the addressee. The article explores additional possibilities for reducing delays and increasing the probability of timely delivery of the most critical requests in the two-stage formation of routes with a possible change in the multiplicity of replication in communication nodes connecting different ways of delivering packages to the addressee. In case of redundant transmission of packets from the request source during route reconfiguration, replication is carried out on the packet delivered first in time. Approaches to reaching a compromise on ensuring timely delivery of a heterogeneous stream to the addressee with different criticality to acceptable network delays are considered. Optimization was carried out under the conditions of uncertainty of changes in traffic intensity. The optimization is compared by the average traffic intensity and with adaptive optimization, taking into account traffic changes. The efficiency of the formation and routes from the source of requests with additional reconfiguration is shown when it is possible to change the multiplicity of transmissions in intermediate communication nodes connecting the formed data delivery paths to the addressee.",

    "abstract": "A preferential attachment (PA) has been suggested to model network evolution and to explain conjectured power-law node degree distributions in real-world networks. In Markovich, Ryzhov (2022a,b), the schemes of the linear PA  proposed in Wan et al. (2020) for the network evolution were suggested for information spreading. The PA and the well-known algorithm SPREAD proposed in Mosk-Aoyama, Shah (2006) were compared regarding the minimum number of evolution steps $K^*$  required to spread a single message among a fixed number of nodes in non-homogeneous directed networks.  This comparison was done  in Markovich, Ryzhov (2022a,b) without node and edge deletion    during the evolution. The objective of the current study is to investigate the impact of the PA parameters on   spreading of a single message to a fixed number of nodes in the graph when an existing node or edge is uniformly deleted  at each step of the PA evolution. The results are provided for  simulated and real graphs.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Gaussian  multi-phase degradation model. The main target quantity is reliability defined as the tail distribution of the system lifetime. When the required performance measure has no closed-form expression one has to rely on simulation methods. Since the reliability is usually extremely small the problem of the rare-event simulation arises. To tackle this problem a few variance reduction methods have been applied. Some numerical experiments are performed to compare the relative error of the proposed estimators.",

In a numerical example, the performance metrics of all-optical switch with a buffer size of two packets are analyzed for different network loads in transient and stationary modes.",

In that investigation, the markovization method was applied for calculation of the main reliability characteristics. \r\nIn the recent paper, reliability function is considered for a repairable k-out-of-n model in the same assumptions about life and repair time distributions. The problem of its sensitivity in case of quick recovery of system\u2019s components is discussed on an example of 2-out-of-n model. It is shown that the reliability function in scale of its mean time to failure is asymptotically exponential.",

    "abstract": "The study of the behaviour of stochastic processes in queuing theory and related fields is often based on the study of the behaviour of regenerative Markov piecewise linear processes. But the behaviour of a complex queuing system or a complex reliability model can be described by a non-regenerative stochastic process, but this non-regenerative process can be in some sense ``close'' to some regenerative process. In this case, embedded processes that would correspond to embedded renewal processes turn out to be in some sense ``close'' to some ``classical'' renewal processes. Therefore, we introduce the concept of quasi-renewal and quasi-regenerative processes, and we give here an example of a quasi-regenerative process and its embedded quasi-renewal process. We also propose a method for obtaining the upper bounds for the convergence rate of the distribution of a regenerative and quasi-regenerative process to a stationary distribution, if this process is ergodic.",

    "title": "On Comparison of Waiting Buffer Scheduling Methods  in a Resource Loss System",
    "abstract": "Fifth-generation (5G) networks are expected to revolutionize wireless communication by enabling faster and more reliable data transfer rates. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies in 5G networks introduces unique challenges in data transmission due to phenomena such as dynamic signal blockage, which can result in sudden and intense resource demands for sessions. This paper presents a mathematical model of a 5G base station using a resource allocation system with waiting and non-homogeneous resource requirements for sessions. The study aims to determine the most efficient way to select sessions from the waiting buffer to increase system performance and minimize the probability of blocking data sessions and reduce waiting time in the waiting buffer. As a result of the research, it was found, that the method that prioritized sessions with the highest resource requirements and took them from the waiting buffer until the system reached its limit, demonstrates the best system performance under certain parameters.",

    "abstract": "A generalized mathematical model of joint servicing of real-time traffic and data (files) traffic in a multiservice access node has been constructed and investigated. The model takes into account the presence of a priority for real-time traffic, as well as the group nature of the arrival, elastic properties, the possibility of waiting and aging of the transmitted information for data traffic. The coming of requests for the transmission of real-time traffic and groups of files obeys the Poisson laws, and the service times have an exponential distribution.\r\nThe definitions of the indicators of the quality of the joint service of incoming requests are formulated and a method for their evaluation based on the solution of a system of equilibrium equations is considered. The use of the model for solving the problems of estimating the value of  transmission resource required to serve  the offered traffic for given QoS indicators and estimating the volume of the offered  traffic offloaded in a situation of congestion to other access nodes in order to achieve the specified QoS indicators is considered.",

    "abstract": "The modern network technology ecosystem is expanding rapidly in multiple dimensions. Due to the demands of the Tactile Internet and fifth-generation (5G) networks, conventional approaches are no longer producing significant advancements. The imminent integration of immersive technologies holds the potential to revolutionize human existence, ushering in a new era of fully realized and enhanced human-to-machine interactions (H2M). This paradigm shift is poised to offer many benefits and adopt wireless technologies to enable real-time remote control. Concurrently, introducing the Tactile Internet necessitates a fundamental reevaluation of the foundational principles governing current and prospective communication networks. This article delves into an experimental endeavor that seeks to seamlessly integrate immersive technologies within 5G networks. A microservice application was developed for this purpose, simulating the nuanced movements of a person\u2019s hand in space and facilitating the expression of intricate gestures. The article also delves into the strategies employed to minimize latency, enhancing the overall experience.",

    "title": "Efficient Transmission of Holographic Images: A Novel Approach Toward 6G Telepresence Services",
    "abstract": "In recent years, advancements in technology have brought forth a new frontier in visual communication. Holography is a technique that captures and reproduces three-dimensional (3D) images with an unprecedented level of realism and depth, has emerged as a groundbreaking method for conveying visual information. Unlike traditional images and videos, holography recreates scenes with full parallax, enabling viewers to perceive objects from various angles. The transmission of holographic images presents both exciting possibilities and unique challenges. To this end, this article investigates a novel method for transmitting holographic images efficiently across communication networks. This innovative approach involves transmitting data related to control point movements rather than the entire image. The technique focuses on capturing the dynamic 3D movements of a person and transmitting information about the shifts in their control points. To achieve this, a system comprising three distinct applications has been devised. These applications are responsible for recording object motion data, converting it into key point coordinates, transmitting it through communication networks, and rendering the data as movements of a 3D object within an augmented reality (AR) application.",

    "title": "Distributed system for scientific and engineering computations with problem containerization and prioritization",
    "abstract": "A key challenge in computer modeling is obtaining numerical results on large input datasets. For instance, this problem arises when researchers need to produce a visualization of an economic or physical process, as well as during the computation of characteristics of complex mathematical models using the Monte Carlo method. Each problem requires repeating the same program on a large set of inputs, consuming much time, from several hours to days and weeks. Computational algorithms may be implemented in different programming languages and may require various specific tools like GNU Octave, NS-3, or OMNeT++. This article describes a distributed system architecture, which can speed up the process of obtaining results for such problems. The system comprises a backend server, a control service (supervisor), worker nodes, and a database. These algorithms are executed in Docker containers to abstract from particular languages and tools required for computational algorithms. The system supports several strategies for problem prioritization to operate efficiently under heavy loads introduced by multiple users. To use the system, the user only needs to build a Docker image with an encapsulated algorithm, describe the input dataset in a JSON file, and upload them via the web interface. The system can be deployed in any public cloud. In this article, we describe the system architecture and numerical results obtained from computations on various clouds and local platforms. We demonstrate that the computation time for CPU-bound problems in different public clouds varies greatly. Finally, we show the influence of different prioritization strategies on the duration of computations under a moderate workload.",

    "title": "On the Machine Learning Models Inversion Attack Detector",
    "abstract": "This article is devoted to the detection of adversarial attacks on machine\r\nlearning models. In the most general case, adversarial attacks are special data\r\nchanges at one of the stages of the machine learning pipeline, which are designed\r\nto either prevent the operation of the machine learning system, or vice versa, to\r\nachieve the desired result for the attacker. But there is also a form of attack\r\naimed at extracting non-public information from machine learning models. These\r\ninclude model inversion attacks. These types of attacks pose a threat to the use\r\nof machine learning as a service (MLaaS). Machine learning models accumulate\r\na lot of redundant information during training, and the possibility of exposing\r\nthis data while using the model can come as an unpleasant surprise.\r\nKeywords: machine learning, adversarial attacks, model inversion\r\n1. Introduction\r\nMachine learning systems (and, at least now, it is a synonym for artificial\r\nintelligence systems) depend on data. This tautological statement leads, in fact, to\r\nquite serious consequences. Changing the data then, generally speaking, changes the\r\nperformance of the model. Purposeful data changes are attacks on machine learning\r\nmodels [1]. But the models themselves can be directly affected during attacks. For\r\nexample, weights can change on the fly, malicious code can be loaded into weights, etc.\r\nAdversarial attacks, which are possible for any discriminant machine learning models,\r\npose a great threat to machine learning systems, since they do not guarantee the\r\nresults and quality of the system. And such guarantees are, for example, mandatory\r\nfor the use of a machine learning (artificial intelligence) system in critical areas such\r\nas avionics, automatic driving, special applications, etc. [2 , 3 ]. An attack directly on\r\nthe model also carries additional risks of extracting private information stored in\r\nmachine learning models [4]. Detection (determination of the fact of implementation)\r\nof attacks related to the extraction of information is the subject of this work.\r\nThe remainder of the article is structured as follows. In section 2, we focus on\r\nattacks on intellectual property. Section 3 presents the developed algorithm for\r\ndetecting extraction attacks. Section 4 presents the conclusion.",

    "abstract": "White blood cells, also known as white blood cells (WBC), play an important role in protecting the human body from foreign intruders, including bacteria and viruses, and dangerous diseases caused by them. The article implements a computer approach to the classification and detection of white blood cells on cytological images of blood cells using deep learning methods. A LeucoCyteNetv2 blood image classification model is proposed, the architecture of which includes SeparableConv2D convolutional layers separated by depth. The developed model classifies leukocytes with an accuracy of 98.86\\%, which allowed us to assert the possibility of their use as an auxiliary tool for hematological blood analysis.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents an example of the so-called surrogate modeling. This is a computer modeling technique where machine learning methods are used to build a fast (surrogate) model that allows you to get a result with acceptable accuracy on data from a complex (physically proven, built on a solution of systems of nonlinear algebraic equations or partial differential equations) and resource-intensive model of an object or process. We develop and analyze the models for calculating  the compressibility factor trained on a large amount of data calculated  with AGA-8 equation of state. The presented models can be applied to replace the original model when analyzing the development of risk situations and searching for optimal gas transportation modes, in software designed for staff training on computer simulators.",

    "title": "About heuristic algorithm for Correlation Clustering problem solving",
    "abstract": "The Correlation Clustering (CC) problem is traditionally defined as a problem of partitioning a signed graph without specifying the number of clusters in advance. In this paper, CC problem is considered for undirected and unweighted signed graphs without multiple edges and loops, where error functional is linear combination of intercluster and intracluster errors. In this formulation, the CC problem is NP-complete. Exact algorithms for this problem are time-consuming. Approximate algorithms for solving CC problem often lead to unsatisfactory results, and heuristic algorithms are often non-deterministic in the number of steps leading to a solution. We propose a new heuristic algorithm SGClustAlpha for CC problem solving. The main idea of this algorithm is in minimizing of intracluster error and optimization of error functional according to the greedy strategy. It was proved that this algorithm takes polynomial time. Numerical experiments were carried out on randomly generated signed graphs.",
