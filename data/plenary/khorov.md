title: "Towards Ultra-High Reliability of Wi-Fi 8"
---
Traditionally, highly reliable data transmission means high probabilities of data delivery. 
If the delay bound is enough, it can be easily achieved with Automated Repeat Request, i.e., retransmissions of undelivered packets. 
The situation changes when the delay budget is small. 
This issue is known as providing ultra-reliable low-latency communications in the 5G community or providing support of real-time applications in the Wi-Fi one. 
The system cannot retransmit undelivered packets and we need to improve reliability of every single transmission attempt. 
Note that in Wi-Fi networks, the main reason why the packets cannot be delivered in time is random access, interference, and traffic peaks. 
With the growing popularity of Cloud VR applications, online gaming and industrial automation, the requirements on delays, losses, and throughput become more challenging. 
In the talk, we will discuss how to satisfy them for any user, any time, and any locations.
We will also consider how the Wi-Fi 8 technology - the development of which starts in 2023 - is going to address this challenge and provide such ultra-high reliability.
