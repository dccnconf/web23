title: "Power and Performance in Parallel Processing"
---
In this talk we briefly review and summarize a few recent results in stochastic modelling of parallel processing systems, which are in fact multiserver queues of various architectures. 
We discuss several methods to obtain the key performance characteristics. 
Due to high power consumption of these systems, we consider the energy efficiency of those as well, which leads to specific models with power demand management.
